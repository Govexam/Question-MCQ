Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Right Answer,Solution
"1. A 6600 V, 50 Hz 3-phase turbo alternator has a stator winding factor of 0.955. If the flux per pole is 1.2 Wb, calculate the number of turns per phase of the stator winding.",15,17,13,20,13,"Using the formula: N = (E × √3) / (4.44 × f × Φ × k_w). With E = 6600 V, f = 50 Hz, Φ = 1.2 Wb, and k_w = 0.955, N ≈ 42.7. Hence, closest value is 13."
2. The voltage regulation of a synchronous generator can be negative when:,The machine runs on light load.,Load power factor is leading.,Load power factor is unity.,Load power factor is lagging.,Load power factor is leading.,"Negative voltage regulation occurs when the load power factor is leading, indicating the generator is supplying reactive power."
3. How can you identify a salient pole rotor?,By the shape of the rotor.,By the speed of the rotor.,By the number of poles.,By the material of the rotor.,By the shape of the rotor.,Salient pole rotors are identified by their projecting or salient physical appearance.
4. With what type of AC generator is electrical energy transmitted to an external load?,Small diameter and large axial length.,Large diameter and large axial length.,Large diameter and small axial length.,Small diameter and small axial length.,Large diameter and large axial length.,"To efficiently transfer electrical energy, a generator typically has a large diameter and large axial length."
5. What type of rotor is used for very high-speed alternators?,Round pole.,Salient pole.,Square pole.,Non-salient pole.,Non-salient pole.,"For very high-speed alternators, a non-salient pole rotor is used."
"6. In a synchronous generator, which statement is correct?",They have a stationary armature and rotating field winding.,Both armature and field winding are stationary.,Both armature and field winding are rotating.,They have a rotating armature and stationary field winding.,They have a stationary armature and rotating field winding.,"In synchronous generators, the armature is stationary and the field winding is rotating."
7. What is the purpose of damper winding in an alternator?,To increase the speed of the alternator.,To provide starting torque.,To reduce the armature reaction effect.,To reduce hunting effect.,To reduce hunting effect.,Damper winding helps to reduce the hunting effect and stabilize the alternator.
"8. A 8-pole alternator is running at 375 rpm. If the number of poles is doubled, what will be the new frequency?",25 Hz,100 Hz,75 Hz,50 Hz,50 Hz,Frequency = (Number of Poles × RPM) / 120. For 8 poles at 375 rpm: 25 Hz. Doubling poles to 16: Frequency = 50 Hz.
